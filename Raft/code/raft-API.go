// Make is
// the service or tester wants to create a Raft server. the ports
// of all the Raft servers (including this one) are in peers[]. this
// server's port is peers[me]. all the servers' peers[] arrays
// have the same order. persister is a place for this server to
// save its persistent state, and also initially holds the most
// recent saved state, if any. applyCh is a channel on which the
// tester or service expects Raft to send ApplyMsg messages.
// Make() must return quickly, so it should start goroutines
// for any long-running work.

// Start is
// the service using Raft (e.g. a k/v server) wants to start
// agreement on the next command to be appended to Raft's log. if this
// server isn't the leader, returns false. otherwise start the
// agreement and
// ** return immediately, without waiting for the log appends to complete. **
// there is no guarantee that this
// command will ever be committed to the Raft log, since the leader
// may fail or lose an election. even if the Raft instance has been killed,
// this function should return gracefully.

// the first return value is the index that the command will appear at
// if it's ever committed. the second return value is the current
// term. the third return value is true if this server believes it is
// the leader.

// CommandValid to true to indicate that the ApplyMsg contains a newly
// committed log entry.

// in Lab 3 you'll want to send other kinds of messages (e.g.,
// snapshots) on the applyCh; at that point you can add fields to
// ApplyMsg, but set CommandValid to false for these other uses.
