// tester) on the same server, via the applyCh passed to Make(). set
// CommandValid to true to indicate that the ApplyMsg contains a newly
// committed log entry.
//
// in Lab 3 you'll want to send other kinds of messages (e.g.,
// snapshots) on the applyCh; at that point you can add fields to
// ApplyMsg, but set CommandValid to false for these other uses.
