// Start is
// the service using Raft (e.g. a k/v server) wants to start
// agreement on the next command to be appended to Raft's log. if this
// server isn't the leader, returns false. otherwise start the
// agreement and return immediately. there is no guarantee that this
// command will ever be committed to the Raft log, since the leader
// may fail or lose an election.

// the first return value is the index that the command will appear at
// if it's ever committed. the second return value is the current
// term. the third return value is true if this server believes it is
// the leader.

// in Kill(), but it might be convenient to (for example)
// turn off debug output from this instance.
